Tally Counter Application
This project implements a simple tally counter using a Redux-inspired store system in JavaScript. The app is designed to increment, decrement, and reset a counter through dispatched actions. It utilizes a minimalist approach, focusing solely on state management without a graphical user interface. All interactions and state changes are logged to the console.


Run the Application: Execute the command {npm run start} in the terminal. This will run the script and output the results 

I did not run into problems after i understood the concept of redux state management
